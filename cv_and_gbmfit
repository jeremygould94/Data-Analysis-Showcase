# Here's an example of how to use train() function from caret package to perform 5-fold cross validation
# on a GBM model using gbm.fit() and non-default options for the hyperparameters:

library(caret)

# load the data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")

# split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(data$y, SplitRatio = 0.7)
train <- subset(data, split == TRUE)
test <- subset(data, split == FALSE)

# specify the formula
formula <- y ~ .

# fit the model using the training data with 5-fold cross validation
fit <- train(formula, data = train, method = "gbm.fit", 
             distribution = "bernoulli", n.trees = 1000,
             shrinkage = 0.01, interaction.depth = 5,
             bag.fraction = 0.5, tree.complexity = 1,
             trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5))

# make predictions using the testing data
predictions <- predict(fit, newdata = test, type = "response")

# convert predictions to binary class labels
predictions <- ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0)

# calculate accuracy
accuracy <- mean(predictions == test$y)
